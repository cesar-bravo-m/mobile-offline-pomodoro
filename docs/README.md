1\. Introduction and Acceptance
------------------------------

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Bravo Ciencia y Tecnología SpA ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Offline Pomodoro mobile application ("App" or "Service"). 

By downloading, installing, or using the Offline Pomodoro app, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this Policy, please do not use our App.

This Policy applies to all users of the Offline Pomodoro app across all platforms and devices.

2\. Information We Do Not Collect
--------------------------------

**Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or process any personal information such as:
- Names, email addresses, or contact information
- Device identifiers (except as noted below)
- Location data
- Biometric information
- User-generated content
- Browsing history or app usage patterns

**App Data:** The Offline Pomodoro app operates entirely offline and does not:
- Transmit any data to our servers
- Store information in cloud services
- Share data with third parties
- Track user behavior or preferences

3\. Information We May Access
----------------------------

**Google Play Analytics (Android Users Only):**
If you downloaded the app from Google Play Store, Google may provide us with aggregated, anonymized analytics data including:
- Number of app installations
- Device types and operating system versions
- Country/region information (aggregated)
- App crash reports (if enabled by your device settings)
- Basic performance metrics

These analytics are collected and managed entirely by Google, not by Offline Pomodoro. We have no control over this data collection, and it is subject to Google's own privacy policy.

**App Store Analytics (iOS Users Only):**
If you downloaded the app from the Apple App Store, Apple may provide us with similar aggregated analytics data through App Store Connect. This data is also anonymized and managed by Apple.

4\. How We Use Information
--------------------------

Since we do not collect personal information, we have no personal data to use. Any aggregated analytics data we may receive from app stores is used solely for:
- Understanding app performance and stability
- Identifying potential technical issues
- Making general improvements to the app experience
- Complying with app store requirements

5\. Data Storage and Security
----------------------------

**Local Storage:** All app data is stored locally on your device and includes:

- Session history (if enabled)
- App configuration settings

This local data:
- Remains on your device only
- Is not backed up to any external servers
- Is deleted when you uninstall the app
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties

**Security Measures:** While we do not collect personal data, we implement appropriate security measures in our app development process to ensure the integrity and safety of the local data storage.

6\. Third-Party Services and Integrations
